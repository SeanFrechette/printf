SYNOPSIS
	#include "holberton.h"
	printf(const char * format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	The printf() function prints a string to stdout.
	The format string will print out as given, unless a percent sign (%) is
	in the string. If the character after the percent sign is in the list
	below, printf will choose the corresponding argument from '...'.
	Ex.
		var1 = "string";
		var2 = 2;
		var3 = "another thing";
		printf("Some %s, or some number %d, and %s\n", var1, var2, var3);

		[STDOUT]

		Some string, or some number 2, and another thing

	The following options are available for special characters after
	the % sign:

	'd'		Prints an integer

	's'		Prints a string

	'c'		Prints a character

	'i'		Prints an integer
